Key principles (always think about these)
=========================================

* Conservation of energy
  * this is the most important principle and should be thought about in nearly every task
* understanding the relations between:
  * energy
  * momentum
  * pressure
  * force
  * acceleration
  * velocity
  * ...
  * => conceptual understanding of derivatives and integrals (slope / area under curve)
* Sanity checks:
  * dimensional analysis: do the units match?
  * limits: is the theory's prediction reasonable when x is close to 0? when y is very large?
  * are the theory's assumptions really valid in the experiment? (e.g. small angles, ...)
    
Advanced mechanics
==================

* torques / angular momentum / angular velocity...
* conservation of momentum
* friction
* Lagrangian mechanics
  * not required, but may appear in some more advanced solutions

Oscillators
===========

* (damped) harmonic oscillator
* resonance / natural frequency
  * remember: possible higher modes!

Wave mechanics
==============

* node, antinode, pressure in space & time
* standing waves
* interference
* sound:
  * *Fourier transform*
  * *resonance*
    * higher harmonics

Optics
======

* Snell's law
* wave optics:
  * diffraction
  * see also *Wave mechanics*

Fluid dynamics
==============

* laminar vs. turbulent flow
  * Reynolds number
    * which length? which velocity? (which parts of the system)
* energy losses

Thermodynamics
==============

* ideal gas law
* processes
* heat transfer

Toolkit
=======

* Fourier transform / FFT
* numerical methods
  * TODO list
