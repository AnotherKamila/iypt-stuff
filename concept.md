title: Coming up with the concept

1. Read the task statement
   * example:
   
     > ... Explain the phenomenon and investigate the relevant parameters.
     
2. Imagine the perfect conclusion for this task
   * example:
     
     > [explanation] It works by A which does B.
     > [parameters] The relevant parameters are:
     > 
     > * X, which scales B linearly and therefore the higher X the better,
     > * Y which B is inversely proportional to and therefore the smaller Y the better, and
     > * Z, which has an optimum due to U and V.
     
   * Note that it may not be immediately obvious what the conclusion should contain. Some initial exploration of the problem (experiments, preliminary theory) may be needed first.
     * Example: In many systems, especially those involving mechanics and/or oscillations, one can observe different modes for different parameter ranges. Therefore an experiment with a large range of parameters (or a comprehensive theory) may be necessary to figure out what we actually want to focus on.
     
   * Think about the motivation behind this problem. Examples:
     * 2018 1 Invent Yourself: The task was to construct a seismograph. The task statement is not very specific. However, real earthquakes have a specific amplitude and frequency range, and measuring real earthquakes requires good time resolution in addition to good amplification. Thinking about the motivation (measuring earthquakes) points you in a good direction.
     * 2013 2 Elastic Space: The task was to find out whether a sheet of elastic material with heavy balls is a good approximation of gravity (as it is often used to illustrate gravity). Though the task does not mention anything specific, the implied application is orbiting objects, such as planetary systems, and therefore after finding the answer "yes, with a caveat" we went further and investigated the equivalent of Kepler's laws in this system.
    
    * read [Writing a Good Conclusion](conclusion) for more details on conclusions, but the main point is this 
    
3. Work backwards to be able to write that conclusion at the end of your presentation.
   * Do not waste time on irrelevant theory or experiments -- focus on what needs to be done to answer the question.
   * Structure your presentation in a way that will lead to your perfect conclusion.
