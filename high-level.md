Always remember:

Your task is to solve the problem
=================================
  
Your task is **not** to:

* confuse the opponent
* confuse the jury
* impress the jury with complicated and irrelevant stuff
* make the other people look bad

etc.

Your task is to **answer the question**.

Do everything needed (and nothing *not* needed) to do that as well as you can.

If you do this well, your awesomeness will be obvious.

Focus on understanding
======================

Focus on understanding of the physics. A more understandable explanation/theory/answer is often preferred to a more comprehensive one.

If something isn't clear to you, it probably isn't clear to the jury either. Clarify all the things!
