> IYPT is a team-oriented scientific competition among teams of secondary school

* 17 open physics problems
  * 3 can be skipped without penalty
* no single solution -- the problems are open-ended
* both theory and experiments needed to succeed
* collaboration with other people (e.g. university professors) is allowed and encouraged
* 12 minutes to present the solution, 14 minutes for the opponent + discussion, 4 minutes for the reviewer

IYPT Participation
------------------

* 1 team per country can participate at the IYPT
  * to select the representation team, regional/country-wide competitions are expected, but this is up to the local organizers
  * if the number of potential participants is small (e.g. when [bootstrapping a new country](http://iypt.org/About/Join)), other ways of selecting the IYPT team are fine
  * it should be possible for anyone in the represented country to participate
* physics fights are in English
* financial:
  * accommodation & co. is provided (for 5 members + 1 team leader, probably -- TODO find out)
  * transportation to the venue, travel insurance and such is **not** provided
  * in some countries participation is funded by the ministry of education
  * in case the team would be unable to participate for financial reasons, partial help may be provided -- TODO find out contact
